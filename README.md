# pyautogui_biclicking
A simple project to perform 2 double clicks on 2 different points

Please run the updated code and follow this revised process:

Click the first point on the screen and press Enter in the terminal.
Switch to the browser and click the second point.
Return to the terminal and click anywhere on the screen to start the iteration.
This should ensure that both points are captured correctly and that the iteration process begins after the user confirms to start.
